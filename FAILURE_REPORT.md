# trapezoid_box — Failure Report

|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-02-26T18:21:39Z | — | 2 sessions, ~11h | SVG visual inspection skipped — hanging tab | 06c_full_base.svg contained a hanging tab (finger overshot arc tangent point by 14.6mm) present since session 12; survived 9 declarations of spec correctness, 2 days, 15 sessions, and external Gemini audit; found only when user opened the file — arithmetic proof passing was treated as equivalent to output correctness, which it is not |
| 2026-02-27T01:28:21Z | +7h 6m | 6 SVG generations, ~25m | SVG visual inspection skipped — trapezoid corner angles inverted | Soundhole rounded-trapezoid corners had obtuse/acute assignment exactly backwards; narrow-end = obtuse (90+leg_angle), wide-end = acute (90−leg_angle) — same rule as body panel, never verified from geometry. Produced blobs/bumps, caught only by user each time. Same root cause as hanging tab: output presented without verifying geometry. Fix: invariant in spec §8, proofs 05+06, claude.md. |
| 2026-02-28T00:00:00Z | +22h 32m | 1 session | fingers() perpendicular sign inverted for SVG y-down | perp computed as `(-d_edge[1], d_edge[0])` (y-up left-of-travel) instead of `(d_edge[1], -d_edge[0])` (correct for SVG y-down). All finger protrusions pointed inward on BASE outer edges and outward on wall slots — geometry exactly inverted. Verification did not catch it: checker tests finiteness and path closure only, not protrusion direction. Root cause: y-down convention known but not applied when writing the formula; no concrete test case challenged the sign. Fix: formula corrected + CLAUDE.md check `d=(1,0)→(0,-1)=up ✓`. |
| 2026-02-28T00:00:00Z | +0 | 1 session | WALL_LONG width used length_o instead of long_o | `build_wall(x,y,length_o,…)` used `length_o=45mm` (BL→TL trapezoid body length) instead of `long_o=65mm` (wide-end edge length). WALL_LONG must span the BASE's wide edge, so its width must equal `long_o`. The joint counts (n_long, fw_long) were correct; the wrong dimension only affected the rect width and bbox, so verification (finiteness + closure) passed silently. Root cause: two similarly-named length variables; name `length_o` plausibly suggests "long" when it means box depth. Fix: variable substituted; label and bbox corrected to match. |
