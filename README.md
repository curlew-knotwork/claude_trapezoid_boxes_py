# claude_trapezoid_boxes_py

Parametric laser-cut box generator for:
- generic: trapezoidal boxes, or
- special case: trapezoidal music instrument bodies (stringed instruments, drums, etc.).
- Cutting a trapezoid shaped base box with a laser cutter that operates orthogonally to the laser bed involves compromises: underfills (air gaps) or overfills and hand woodwork (eg sanding, beveling). This is due to the limitations of working with 90 degree cutting angle (to the laser bed). 

Note: This project is an experiment in collaborating with Claude Code to
see if it can be made to generate good, correct code, on the first try by
having a sufficiently detailed analysis and specification phase: applied
to a bounded problem of laser cutting trapezoid boxes with a laser cutter
that only works with a bed and orthogonal laser.

Version: **v0.20** — spec complete, geometry verified, implementation pending.

Status: Code, etc. is from Claude "as is" with no warranty of any kind whatsoever.
None of it has been tried or tested yet with a real laser cutter. 26 Feb 2026

License: 'No License' at the present time.

## What it does

Generates a DXF/SVG sheet layout for a six-panel finger-jointed box with:

- Trapezoidal planform (long end wider than short end)
- Angled leg walls (non-orthogonal)
- Rounded corners (arcs tangent to edges)
- Sliding lid or lift-off lid
- Optional soundboard with Helmholtz-tuned sound hole (round, slot, or triskele)
- Optional neck slot with kerfing plugs
- Kerf compensation on all joints
- TEST_STRIP panel for physical kerf calibration before full cut

All finger joints inherit position from BASE (BASE-as-master rule). Wall panels do not recompute their own finger zones independently.

## Before implementing

Run all seven proof scripts in order. They require Python 3.9+, stdlib only, no pip installs.

```bash
cd proofs/
python3 01_trapezoid_geometry.py
python3 02_corner_arcs.py
python3 03_finger_joints.py
python3 04_panel_alignment.py
python3 05_helmholtz.py
python3 06_svg_primitives.py   # generates SVG files — open in Inkscape
python3 07_assembly_simulation.py
```

All seven must reach `ALL PASS` before any implementation begins. If any fail, the script prints the failing check with expected vs actual values. The spec is the reference — fix the spec formula first, then re-run.

**Current status: all 7 pass.** 171 checks total, 0 failures.

## Key geometry rules

**BASE-as-master:** All wall panel finger zones inherit from BASE. Wall panels do not compute their own finger start positions. Independent computation produces a 0.739 mm offset — 7× the 0.1 mm assembly tolerance.

**Angled joint corrections:**
- `D_eff = T / cos(α)` — effective slot depth for leg walls
- `W_over = T × tan(α)` — rotational clearance consumed during assembly

**Corner arc bisector:** `normalise(−edge_a_dir + edge_b_dir)` — the wrong formula `normalise(−edge_a_dir − edge_b_dir)` produces a centre 8.35 mm from arc_start instead of 9.00 mm. Arc will not be tangent.

**Sliding lid width:** `short_inner − 2×(T+tol)` — NOT `short_outer + 2×(T+tol)`. Wrong formula gives 126.2 mm, which is 18.4 mm wider than the groove span.

## Material requirements (dulcimer preset)

| Mode | Sheet size | Qty |
|---|---|---|
| Box only (no soundboard) | 600 × 400 mm, 3 mm ply/MDF | 1 |
| Instrument (with soundboard + kerfing) | 600 × 400 mm, 3 mm ply/MDF | 2 |
| Kerf calibration test strips only | ~120 × 270 mm offcut | — |

Largest single panel: BASE at 180 × 380 mm. Minimum laser bed: 400 × 400 mm.

---

## Kerf calibration

Before cutting full panels, cut two copies of the TEST_STRIP panel and test fit. See `docs/trapezoid_boxes_test_strip_guide.docx` for the full procedure.

Short version:
1. Cut two TEST_STRIP pieces from scrap (same material as box)
2. Offset one by one finger width (~9.44 mm), press together by thumb
3. Too tight → **decrease** kerf_compensation. Too loose → **increase** kerf_compensation
4. Iterate until snug. Record value.

## Claude Code configuration

This project uses [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) as its AI coding assistant. Claude Code loads instruction files automatically from standard locations:

| File | Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Global (all projects) | Generic engineering discipline, self-review protocol |
| `CLAUDE.md` (project root) | This project only | Burn model, geometry rules, SVG output rules |
| `CLAUDE.local.md` (project root) | Local machine only, gitignored | Personal overrides |

The project-level `CLAUDE.md` is version-controlled and documents the laser-cutting domain rules that Claude must follow. The global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` holds general software engineering standards that apply to all projects.

## Spec document

`docs/trapezoid_boxes_specification_v2.0.docx` is the authoritative source of truth. The code must conform to the spec. If there is a conflict between code and spec, fix the code.
